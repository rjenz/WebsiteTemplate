# Website Template

A simple website template for use with my [StaticSiteGenerator](https://github.com/rjenz/StaticSiteGenerator).

This template is used in a couple of my websites and deliver a reconcilable design language between my projects. It provides both a singlepage and multipage layout.

Build upon semantic HTML with (hopefully) good enough accessibility.

Minimal JavaScript and no external preprocessors, other than my [StaticSiteGenerator](https://github.com/rjenz/StaticSiteGenerator), should reduce maintenance to a minimum.
